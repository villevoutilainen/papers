<h1 align=center>The default access for reflection APIs</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This paper explains the concerns some people have about
  the default access approach of the reflection APIs in
  <a href="https://wg21.link/p2996">P2996</a>.
</p>
<p>In short, we have a function named 'members_of', which gives
  a reflection of every member of a class, regardless of access.
  We have a plan to add a function named 'get_accessible_members',
  which gives a reflection of members accessible by a given context.
<p>
<p>Considering that the shorter and nicer name is given to the
  function that effectively bypasses access, we can reasonably
  say that our default is that reflection bypasses access.
</p>

<p>EWG polled the matter, and there was no consensus to make
  a change, but there was a majority very near to consensus
  numbers for doing so.</p>

<p>Some compiler vendors are seriously considering warning
  about the uses of members_of, and their desire to warn
  might become alleviated if the naming were different.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>Various library authors, including standard library vendors,
  do not want users to depend on private implementation details,
  and do not want users to form untoward dependencies on such details.</p>

<p>While it's understood that various use cases like allocators
  and relocation traits written before such traits are standardized
  can benefit from being able to introspect types and other properties
  of even private data members, there is a strong preference that
  that is done judiciously, and with a clearer indication that
  such uses accept the possibility that they are sometimes broken
  by refactorings done by library authors.
<p>

<p>It is thought to be so that a short and innocent name like 'members_of'
  doesn't convey that sufficiently. Hence, there is a suggestion to
  give the form of reflection that respects access controls the
  short and convenient name, and to give access-bypassing reflection
  facilities a less convenient and a more inconvenient name.</p>

<h2>The proposed solution</h2>

<p>Two options:
  <ol>
    <li>Disambiguate with an "inconvenience" tag:

      <ul>
	<li>Take the about-to-be-proposed get_accessible_members, and give those semantics the name 'members_of'.</li>
	<li>Provide an alternate overload that takes a tag-type object
	</li>
      </ul>
      So the different calls would look roughly like
	<pre><blockquote>members_of(^^Foo, access_context::current()) // or leave out the argument
members_of(^^Foo, include_inaccessible)</blockquote></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Separate the functionality to different function names:
	<pre><blockquote>members_of(^^Foo, access_context::current()) // or leave out the argument
get_members_including_inaccessible()</blockquote></pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  It's important to keep two things in mind here:
  <ul>
    <li>the access-obeying API needs to return different things in different contexts, sometimes</li>
    <li>the access-bypassing API returns the same result in all contexts.
  </ul>
  So, the set of included inaccessible parts may be empty for the access-bypassing query. But it does return the same result everywhere. It returns the union set of accessible and inaccessible members, and what is in which set changes
  in different contexts, but the union is the same everywhere.
</p>
<p>Consider that difference in how the functions work, it might be more
  reasonable to have the functions be more separated than being
  different overloads in the same overload set.
</p>
<p>The API should still likely include a 'has_inaccessible_member', for
  cases where the user uses the access-obeying API but wants to know
  whether the set not included in its result is empty.
