<h1 align=center>Disentangling schedulers and executors</h1>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>
  Many many thanks to Tomasz Kami&#x0144;ski for a very high-quality
  technical review of this paper.
</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
  This proposal proposes to simplify the design of schedulers and executors,
  providing a single conversion facility from an <code>executor</code> to
  a <code>scheduler</code>,
  removing the non-scheduler/sender/receiver facilities from
  <code>schedule</code> and <code>connect</code>.
  This proposal *also* removes the ability to
  <code>execute</code> on a sender.
</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>
  Schedulers and executors are apples and oranges. Schedulers, senders,
  and receivers establish a generic protocol that is knit together
  so as to facilitate generic programming and algorithms that can
  operate within the framework of that protocol, transforming in various
  ways what senders and receivers do. Executors do not work with this
  protocol, because they do not provide two thirds of it; namely,
  they do not provide any means to ever invoke set_error or set_done.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore treating an executor as a scheduler is akin to a lossy
  conversion. The conversion is sufficiently lossy that it would be unwise
  if it Just Happens without any indication in source code. That's why
  multiple reviewers have suggested that that conversion should be
  explicit. This proposal makes it explicit.
</p>
<p>
  Once we accept that an executor shouldn't just be treated as a scheduler,
  we also realize that there's no point in providing support for treating
  + a sender-of-void as an executor in the execution::execute() CPO.
  Such an operation is every bit as lossy as treating an executor as
  a scheduler. It should be likewise explicit, and there's no reason
  to provide it in the fundamental building blocks; a separate algorithm
  can be provided that connects a plain invocable to a sender.
</p>
<p>
  In a slightly different vein, a scheduler or a sender should not be treated
  as an executor either. That's not like a lossy conversion, but it's
  like invoking a function with a wide contract, and then having it be
  overridden by a function with a narrow contract, and thus the caller
  expectations of a wide contract aren't met. The semantics of execute()
  are intentionally rather free-form. There is no generic protocol that
  executors conform to, but senders and receivers do have such a protocol,
  and schedulers *will* conform to it, causing naive users of execute
  on senders to shoot themselves in the foot. Furthermore, that protocol
  will intercept attempts to implement custom protocols solely in the operator()
  of the user-provided runnable; the handling of scheduling errors
  will happen in schedulers before that runnable is invoked,
  thwarting the attempts to implement something custom and breaking
  expectations for a custom protocol.
</p>
<p>
  These apples and oranges don't mix. In either direction. Cross-pollination
  attempts should be explicit, visible, greppable, and done with utmost care.
</p>
<h3>How?</h3>

<ol>
  <li><code>schedule()</code> operates on schedulers only.</li>
  <li><code>execute()</code> is a customization point that operates on an executor only.</li>
  <li>All senders&amp;receivers-related operations, like <code>connect()</code>,
    operate on senders&amp;receivers only.</li>
  <li>There is a conversion function that takes an executor, and converts it
    to a scheduler. The working name for this function
    is <code>make_scheduler_from_executor()</code>, because that's what it does.</li>
  <li>Separate algorithms, most likely and preferrably with names other
    than 'execute', can be provided in e.g. <a href="https://wg21.link/p1897">P1897</a> to allow straightforward fire-and-forget on schedulers
    or senders.
</ol>

<h2>Rumination</h2>

<h3>The current design is complex, confusing, and error-prone</h3>

<p>
  The current design allows execute() on anything, schedule() on anything,
  connect() on anything. But that makes no sense; execute() is okay
  as a one-way fire-and-forget mechanism when no particular error-handling
  semantics are expected, but schedule() on an executor
  tosses in the wind the <code>set_error/set_done</code> parts. Those
  parts are absolutely necessary for some senders&amp;receivers use
  cases to work. Padding them in with operations that e.g.
  <code>terminate</code> shouldn't just happen willy-nilly. Otherwise
  it becomes impossible to reason about generic code, and to trust
  that senders are actual senders, receivers are actual receivers,
  and that the senders&amp;receivers protocol actually works.
  As far as execute() goes, the story is similar. What we have
  right now will terminate() a program if there is a scheduling
  error. This becomes ever more likely when programs and applications
  using these facilities grow more complex; simple schedulers&amp;senders&amp;receivers combine into more complicated ones, increasing the chance
  that scheduling errors will not be just allocation failures, but
  something much more likely, such as i/o errors. Thus, simply executing
  on a sender that has terminate() called from its receivers' set_done/set_error
  is a massive footgun. It's also a massive footgun if we make executing
  on a sender actually work properly with the sender&amp;receiver protocol,
  since transitioning to the executor world will again drop that protocol.
</p>

<p>
  This proposal makes the design clearer. In order to make the jump
  from executors (which don't conform to any protocol) to senders&amp;receivers,
  there is exactly one conversion operation that crosses that bridge
  (or rather jumps over the river when there is no bridge)
  Otherwise, the separate worlds are kept separate. Similarly,
  the jump from senders&amp;receivers to executors doesn't introduce
  surprises when an execute function would do drastically different
  things depending on what it's invoked on. This avoids a vector&lt;bool&gt;
  problem that we currently have in the design of P0443. Any jumps
  back and forth between the worlds don't introduce surprises either.
</p>
<p>
  Once in a senders&amp;receivers world, all operations related to them
  work as expected. The cross-river jump mentioned before is easy
  to find, and is greppable. One doesn't need to look at all operations,
  including <code>schedule</code> and <code>connect</code> and wonder
  whether they're operating on a scheduler and a sender or perhaps
  an executor and an invocable.
</p>
<p>
  Simlilarily, once in an executor world, the operations related to an executor
  work as expected. In order to have a protocol, or to deal with
  executor-specific means of handling scheduling errors, that needs to be
  programmed explicitly, instead of having a sender introduce a protocol
  where it's perhaps not expected or even desired.
</p>
<p>
  It's still perfectly plausible to provide a function that queues
  a plain invocable to run as an error-ignoring receiver of a sender.
  But that's a separate named algorithm, not an overload of <code>connect</code>. It's still possible to indirectly call <code>schedule</code> on an executor,
  but that's <code>schedule(make_scheduler_from_executor(foo))</code>,
  not <code>schedule(foo)</code>.
</p>

<h3>The cross-concept bridging the current design attempts is not
  useful for programmers</h3>

<p>
  We are going to see a fair amount of generic algorithms that
  operate on senders. These algorithms will provide decorators
  that change (sometimes extend, sometimes transform) what
  senders, receivers, and operation_states do. They will be lego-like
  building blocks that introduce a particular form of aspect-oriented
  programming into the world of senders and receivers.
</p>
<p>
  Programmers, even library programmers, are expected to be mostly using
  such algorithms, rather than using things like <code>connect()</code>
  directly. These algorithms will be constrained to accept
  <code>schedulers, </code><code>senders</code>
  and <code>receivers</code>. They will not be constrained to accept
  both <code>schedulers</code> and <code>executors</code> even if the
  cross-concept bridging that's currently in P0443 might make using
  them on <code>executors</code> well-formed.
</p>
<p>
  And, again, code that uses executors will probably do so with the expectation
  that there is a particular custom protocol in play, or no protocol at all.
  Implicitly introducing the senders&amp;receivers protocol into code that has
  the aforementioned expectation(s) can be a massively breaking change.
</p>
<p>
  We need a clear, simple, and understandable story of what our concepts
  are and what they do. That means we shouldn't encourage every programmer
  to deal with a <code>scheduler_or_executor</code> concept that's basically
  a disjunction of the two concepts. Executors aren't schedulers, so let's
  not pretend that they are. For those who insist on treating an executor
  as a scheduler, we provide them with a very explicit conversion function.
  Executors are a perfectly reasonable family of types in and of themselves,
  types that provide a less strict protocol than schedulers do; that's fine,
  those types can be used by audiences who have no use for the
  senders-and-receivers protocol. But as long as those audiences don't
  have a use for the senders-and-receivers protocol, we make the conversion
  from an executor to a scheduler _deliberately_ ugly. And as long as those
  audiences don't have a use for the senders-and-receivers protocol, we
  don't inflict it on those audiences implicitly, either.
</p>

<h3>All that considered, is make_scheduler_from_executor fundamental for P0443?</h3>

<p>
  That would be no. We could just as well do something like it separately in P1897. It's proposed here to provide a better overall view of the cross-concept
  picture, but doesn't strictly need to be in P0443.
</p>

<h3>What about bridging to the other direction? Why is there no make_executor_from_sender proposed here?</h3>

<p>
  Such a facility is frought with peril. A sender will report scheduling errors.
  For an executor, those errors have nowhere to go. Thus they would
  be unhandled errors, and would need to be intercepted and most likely
  call terminate(). What makes it worse is that you can take a sender,
  and apply an error-handling algorithm on top of it, which would otherwise
  intercept the set_error calls and do what that algorithm defines.
  But a hypothetical make_executor_from_sender wouldn't know that, so it would
  need to intercept set_error, and those intercepts would cause termination
  even if an algorithm that would make those intercepts unnecessary
  has already been applied.
</p>

<h2>Changes to P0443</h2>

<p>
  In 2.2.3.4 execution::execute, modify the second paragraph and remove
  the third bullet:
<p>

<p>
  For some subexpressions e and f, let E be decltype((e)) and let F be decltype((f)). The expression execution::execute(e, f) is ill-formed if F does not model invocable, or if E does not model<del> either</del> executor <del>or sender</del>. Otherwise, it is expression-equivalent to:
</p>
<pre><ul>
    <li>e.execute(f), if that expression is valid. If the function selected does not execute the function object f on the executor e, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, execute(e, f), if that expression is valid, with overload resolution performed in a context that includes the declaration

      void execute();

and that does not include a declaration of execution::execute. If the function selected by overload resolution does not execute the function object f on the executor e, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.</li>
    <li><del>Otherwise, execution::submit(e, as-receiver&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;F&gt;, E&gt;{forward&lt;F&gt;(f)}) if</del>
      <ul>
        <li><del>F is not an instance of as-invocable&lt;R,E'&gt; for some type R where E and E' name the same type ignoring cv and reference qualifiers, and</del></li>

  In 2.2.3.5 execution::connect, remove the third bullet:

  <del><li>Otherwise, as-operation{s, r}, if

      <li>r is not an instance of as-receiver&lt;F, S'> for some type F where S and S' name the same type ignoring cv and reference qualifiers, and</li>

    <li>receiver_of&lt;R&gt; && executor-of-impl&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;S&gt;, as-invocable&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;R&gt;, S&gt;&gt; is true,</li>

    } catch(...) {
      execution::set_error(std::move(r_), current_exception());
    }
  };
</pre>
<p>and as-invocable is a class template equivalent to the following:</p>

<pre>  template&lt;class R, class&gt;

<li>Otherwise, execution::connect(s, r) is ill-formed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In 2.2.3.8 execution::schedule, remove the third bullet:
</p>
<ul>
<del><li>Otherwise, as-sender&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;S&gt;&gt;{s} if S satisfies executor, where as-sender is an implementation-defined class template equivalent to

<h2>What This Buys</h2>

<p>
  The user can no longer pass an executor to <code>schedule()</code>
  or <code>connect()</code>, and have the code be well-formed, but with broken
  runtime semantics.  Such code is extremely likely to be a mistake.
