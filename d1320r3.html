<h1 align=center>Allowing contract predicates on non-first declarations</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  This paper proposes allowing contract predicates on non-first
  declarations for a member function. The rationale of doing so is,
  in a nutshell, to allow preconditions and postconditions
  to be implementation details. This thus also introduces the
  ability to redeclare a member function with a non-defining
  redeclaration.
</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<h3>How is this a bug fix?</h3>

<p>
  There is a desire to write programs where contract checks
  are implementation details. When they aren't, work-arounds
  will be written. We'd prefer having direct support for contract checks
  as implementation details, rather than necessitating the work-arounds.
</p>

<h3>Why this feature is deemed necessary</h3>

<p>
  The support for contract checking adopted for C++20 allows decorating
  function declarations with annotations for the function's pre- and
  postconditions for both free functions and member functions of a class.
  The current WP requires the contract annotations for either case to be
  attached to the first function declaration. 
</p>

<p>
  There are users that do not want to expose a contract checking
  mechanism in their class interfaces; there may be an English
  contract, but the language-level contract enforcement mechanism
  is an implementation detail that function declarations in
  a class definition should not expose.
</p>

<p>
  Annotating the declaration in a typical scenario of having the declaration
  in a header file and the definition in a source file allows the contract
  checking annotations to be visible in more than one translation unit to
  compilers, static analyzers, and other tools working on per-TU basis.
  For a human reader, however, in case a proper English contract is provided
  in form of a comment, the contract-checking annotations only serve
  to expose the implementation details of which contract checks are performed
  and which level they are performed at. This not only distracts from the
  properly defined full contract, but also increases the overall length
  of a function declaration, especially if the lists of contract-checking
  annotations are long and many functions are declared within the same
  (class or namespace) scope. In addition, it is currently not possible
  to provide a fully insulated implementation of a function with regard
  to pre- and postcondition checks – any change in the contract annotations
  would necessarily require recompilation of all clients of a function or class.
</p>

<p>
  It is probable that some would suggest that such use cases
  could be handled with contract assertions in function bodies.
  The reason why this paper proposes allowing contract predicates
  on non-first declarations is that
  <ul>
    <li>In some cases, there is no body to put an assertion in;
      defaulted functions and pure virtual functions are examples
      of this.</li>
    <li>For postconditions, postconditions are guaranteed to
      be checked (when checking is enabled in the first place) at function
      exit; relying on contract assertions is more error-prone.
  </ul>
  Furthermore, such an approach either forces to provide the
  implementation inline or loses the advantages of having the
  contract-checking annotations in the header file.
</p>


<h2>Usage examples</h2>

<p>
  We basically propose being able to do this (case #1):<pre>
    <code>
      struct X
      {
          void f();
      };

      void X::f() [[expects: foo]]
      {
         ...
      }
    </code>
  </pre>
</p>
<p>
  In addition, though, what is also proposed is this (case #2):<pre>
    <code>
      struct Y
      {
          void f();
      };
      void Y::f() [[expects: foo]];

      // definition possibly in a separate translation unit
      void Y::f() [[expects: foo]]
      {
         ...
      }
    </code>
  </pre>
</p>

<h2>Implementation impact, semantic restrictions</h2>

<p>
  Allowing contract predicates on a non-first declaration
  probably means that in some such cases, the checking code
  can't be laid down at the call site unless the definition
  is also seen by the compiler.
</p>

<p>
  This leads to an implementation concern about being able
  to decide whether all contract-checking is always done
  at the definition site, or whether it's possible to
  allow the caller to do that.
</p>

<p>
  Based on an explanation by an implementation vendor,
  what we need to do is as follows:
  <ol>
    <li>If a class definition has a member function declaration
      <em>without</em> a contract on it, contract checking
      can be done at the call site if and only if the caller
      sees another declaration with a contract on it and the
      definition also sees such a declaration (possibly being
      one itself).
    <li>If a class definition has a member function declaration
      <em>with</em> a contract on it, the contract checking
      can be done at the call site regardless of other declarations.</li>
    <li>If the member function declaration in the class definition
      did not have a contract, and an outside-of-class declaration
      visible to the caller has a contract, and there is no
      declaration visible at the
      site of the definition with a contract on it, the program
      is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.
    <li>If a function declaration <em>doesn't</em> have a contract on it, 
      contract checking can be done at the call site if and only if the caller
      sees another declaration with a contract on it and the definition also 
      sees such a declaration (possibly being one itself).
    <li>If there exists a function declaration with a contract on it visible 
      to the caller, and there is no declaration with a contract visible at the
      site of the definition, the program is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.
  </ol>
</p>

<h2>Out of class member function declarations</h2>
<p>
In order to support case #2, member functions declarations should be allowed outside of the class definition.
<pre> <code>
struct A
{
     void f();
};
void A::f() [[expects: foo]]; 
</code></pre></p>
<p>
The proposal does not suggest allowing redeclarations within the class definition.  
<pre><code>
struct B
{
     void f();
     void f() [[expects: foo]]; //error, redeclaration within class definition
}
</code> </pre></p>
<p>
Suggested rules for default arguments on out of class member function declarations are the same as rules for default arguments on non-member function declarations.  
<pre> <code>
struct C
{
     void foo(int i, int j, int k = 3);
};

void C::foo(int i = 1, int j, int k); // error: no previous default argument for parameter j
void C::foo(int i, int j = 3, int k); // ok
void C::foo(int i, int j, int k = 3); // error: cannot redefine, even to same value
</code></pre></p>
<p>
Suggested inline specifier rules for out of class member function declarations are the same as rules for the inline specifier when applied to non-member functions.   
<pre> <code>
struct D1
{
     void foo();
};

inline void D1::foo(); 
void D1::foo(){} // ok, D1::foo is inline

struct D2
{
     void foo();
};

void D2::foo(){} 
inline void D2::foo(); // error, first declaration as inline after definition
</code>  </pre></p>

<h2>Implementation experience</h2>

<p>
  This proposal, along with many other things, has been implemented
  in <a href="https://gitlab.com/lock3/gcc-new">https://gitlab.com/lock3/gcc-new</a>. Notably, that implementation doesn't place the semantic requirement
  on non-member functions.
</p>

<h2>Wording</h2>

<p>
  In [dcl.fct.default]/6, modify as follows:
  <pre><blockquote>Except for member functions of class templates, the default arguments in a member function <del>definition</del><ins>declaration</ins> that
appears outside of the class definition are added to the set of default arguments provided by the member
function declaration in the class definition;
</blockquote></pre>      
<p>

<p>
  In [class.mfct]/1, remove the redeclaration restriction:
  <pre><blockquote>A member function <del>definition</del><ins>declaration</ins> that appears outside of 
the class definition shall appear in a namespace scope enclosing the class definition.<ins> A member function 
declaration shall appear in a class definition only once.</ins><del> Except for member function definitions
that appear outside of a class definition, and except for explicit specializations of member functions of class
templates and member function templates (12.8) appearing outside of the class definition, a member function
shall not be redeclared.</del>
</blockquote></pre>      
<p>
<p>
  In [class.mfct]/2, modify as follows:
  <pre><blockquote>An inline member function (whether static or non-static) may also be defined outside of its class definition
provided <del>either its declaration in the class definition or its definition outside of the class definition</del>
<ins>there exists a declaration that</sel> declares the function as inline or constexpr.
</blockquote></pre>      
<p>
<p>
  In [class.mfct]/4, modify as follows:
  <pre><blockquote>If the <del>definition</del><ins>declaration</ins> of a member function is lexically outside its class definition, 
the member function name shall be qualified by its class name using the :: operator. [<i>Note</I>: A name used in a member function 
<del>definition</del><ins>declaration</ins> (that is, in the <i>parameter-declaration-clause</i> including the default arguments 
(9.2.3.6) or in the member function body) is looked up as described in 6.4. — <i>end note</i>]
</blockquote></pre>      
<p>
	
<p>In [dcl.attr.contract.cond]/1, modify as follows:
  <pre><blockquote>A contract condition is a precondition or a postcondition.<ins>If </ins><del>T</del><ins>t</ins>he first declaration 
of a function<ins> has a contract condition, it</ins> shall specify all contract conditions <del>(if any) </del>of the function. <ins>
For a non-member function, all declarations that specify a contract condition shall specify the same list of contract conditions. 
For a member function, a member function redeclaration outside a class definition may specify contract conditions different from the
ones in the declaration inside a class definition if the declaration inside a class definition had no contract conditions.</ins>
Subsequent declarations shall either specify no contract conditions or the same list of contract conditions; no diagnostic is required 
if corresponding conditions will always evaluate to the same value.<ins>For a non-member function, </ins><del>T</del><ins>t</ins>he list 
of contract conditions of a function shall be the same if the declarations of that function <ins>that contain contract conditions </ins>
appear in different translation units;no diagnostic required. <ins>For a member function, the  list of contract conditions of a function 
shall be the same if the redeclarations outside a class definition of that function appear in different translation units; no diagnostic 
required. [Note: a declaration in a class definition and a declaration outside the class definition may have different lists of contract 
conditions. --end note] If a definition of a function is reachable at the point of its first declaration that contains contract conditions, 
the program is ill-formed;no diagnostic required.</ins>
</blockquote></pre>
